        # Write a script that employs a c-style loop to calculate the sum of two assignment scores as they appear
        # ordinarily in separate arrays. The arrays are as follows:
        # First Array 12 18 20 10 12 16 15 19 8 11
        # Second Array 22 29 30 20 18 24 25 26 29 30
        # For example, the first two assignment scores to be added would be 12 and 22.
        # The output to the screen of the results should be as follows:
        # Student_1 Result: xx
        # Student_2 Result: xx
        # Student_3 Result: xx
        # Student_4 Result: xx
        # Student_5 Result: xx
        # Student_6 Result: xx
        # Student_7 Result: xx
        # Student_8 Result: xx
        # Student_9 Result: xx
        # Student_10 Result: xx
        # â€¦where xx represents the sum of the two corresponding assignment scores in each array.
